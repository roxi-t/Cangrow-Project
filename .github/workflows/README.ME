CI/CD Pipeline for WordPress Theme Deployment
Overview
This repository contains the configuration for a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline aimed at automating the deployment process of a WordPress theme. Whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository, the CI/CD pipeline is triggered to deploy the latest changes to the WordPress theme.

Workflow
The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following steps:

Checkout repository: This step ensures that the latest code from the repository is fetched.
Deploy to WordPress Theme: The changes are deployed to the designated WordPress theme directory.
Publishing: The changes are published to the gh-pages branch for deployment.
Usage
To use this CI/CD pipeline for your WordPress theme deployment, follow these steps:

Fork this repository.
Modify the configuration in the .github/workflows/main.yml file to suit your project requirements, such as changing the publish_dir to point to your WordPress theme directory.
Ensure that you have set up the required GitHub secrets, particularly the GH_PAGES_TOKEN, which is used for authentication during deployment.
Push your changes to the main branch, and the CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy your WordPress theme.
Configuration
personal_token: A personal access token used for authentication during deployment. Ensure that this token has the necessary permissions to deploy changes.
publish_dir: The directory where the changes will be deployed. Modify this path to match the directory structure of your WordPress theme.
publish_branch: The branch to which the changes will be published for deployment.
allow_empty_commit: Determines whether an empty commit should be created if no changes are detected.
