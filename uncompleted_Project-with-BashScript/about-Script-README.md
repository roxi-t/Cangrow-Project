# Project README

Docker Compose files are placed in this directory along with executable Bash scripts. I tried to use these Bash scripts in the project and include them in the Docker Compose file, but either my syntax for calling them in the Docker Compose file was incorrect or I failed to call these Bash scripts correctly.

Please note that the unfinished_Project-with-BashScript directory is not part of the actual project. It is for demonstration purposes only to show the type of write in Bash scripts and Docker Compose file structure. So, don't run the project in this part. The problem I encountered was the inability to execute and correctly call Bash scripts in the project.

Feel free to check out the contents of this directory for a reference to Bash scripting and the Docker Compose file structure, but don't consider it part of the main project setup.

To successfully run the project without using Bash scripts, you can navigate to the section3 directory by running cd /home/roxi-t/docker/Cangrow-Project/section3 and then run docker-compose up -d . It runs the project with 6 containers as intended.
