# Project README

## Overview

This directory contains Docker Compose files and executable Bash scripts intended for project setup and demonstration purposes. Below is an explanation of the current structure, the issues encountered, and guidance on how to correctly deploy the project.

## Directory Structure and Contents

- **Docker Compose Files**: These are used to configure and run Docker containers for the project.
- **Executable Bash Scripts**: Intended to be integrated within the Docker Compose workflows but currently not functioning as expected.

## Important Notes

### Unfinished Project with Bash Script
The `unfinished_Project-with-BashScript` directory serves solely for demonstration purposes. It showcases our initial attempts at integrating Bash scripts with Docker Compose files. **Please note**:
- This directory is **not** part of the actual project deployment.
- The Bash scripts and Docker Compose integration within this directory are not operational due to syntax issues and execution errors.

### Recommendations
- **Do not run any deployments** from the `unfinished_Project-with-BashScript` directory as it is incomplete and may not work as intended.
- Use the contents of this directory as a reference for learning about Bash scripting and Docker Compose file structure.

## Running the Project

To run the main project without the use of Bash scripts, please follow the steps below:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Change to the `section3` directory where the functional Docker Compose setup is located:
   ```shell
   cd Cangrow-Project/section3
Start the Project:
Launch the Docker containers using:
```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
This command will start the project with six containers, operating as intended.

**Conclusion**
This README aims to clarify the purpose and use of different directories and scripts within the project. For successful deployment, follow the instructions outlined above to avoid the non-functional parts and focus on the operational aspects of the project.
